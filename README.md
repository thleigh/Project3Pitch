Elevator Pitch: Affirmations is an app created through React and MongoDB that encourages and informs users that are struggling or just curious about suicide and depression.
It is simple by nature, allowing it to be accessible to everyone and beautiful to the eye to make it less intimidating to the average user. 
Affirmations strives to be a safe place for all and keeps the mental and physical safety of its users as its highest priority.

### User Stories

<p> With Covid-19 causing most people to lose a big part of their lives and  with suicide prevention month coming up in September, 
the access to self care and mental health assistance is at the highest of importance.
Users will be greeted with a daily encouraging qoute customized to how they are feeling that will affirm them and make them feel positive about themselves and their situation.
Users will be able to create annoymous accounts(like reddit) to make posts about their feelings and if they are seeking any type of advice. Other users may commment. 
At request, users may sign up to be a volunteer. Volunteers will put their number into a database and their number will be randomly picked
if another user is looking to talk to someone personal.
Users will have quick and clear access to professional help that will help them if they have a problem, such as depressions, anxiety, 
self doubt, etc.
With this app, we hope to create an inclusive place to inform people and where people can feel safe talking about suicide and getting the proper help that they need. <p>
